# Mastodon-Stadium-Seats
Enter a list of hashtags to monitor and Mastodon instances, and MSS makes a plain, full-screen display that updates every 90 seconds.

I run a very small Mastodon instance. When news breaks or there's a big event happening, I often miss a lot of posts because only a limited amount of fediverse content gets to me. This is unsatisfying because I'm used to Twitter's fuller news firehose, but at the same time I don't want to have to find a bunch of people to follow every time news breaks in order to GET that fuller news firehose.

Mastodon Stadium Seats goes straight to the larger instances - or whatever instances you specify - to find news. MSS searches the instances you specify for the hashtags you specify and presents the most recent 14 posts in a plain, full-screen, two-column format. No media is included, just text. 

I'm putting this up because someone requested me to; it's just a code doodle and I expect to do a lot of tweaking.
